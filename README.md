Tools to extract flat lands

The inspiration for this toolkit comes from the topography of Florida, particularly with respect to paleoshorelines such as the Trail Ridge, which shows evidence of relative uplift in the central part of the state. Flanking the ridge are broad, relatively flat regions. The goal of this project is to extract these flat regions in order to compute spatial statistics and look for additional clues to the geologic history of Florida.
